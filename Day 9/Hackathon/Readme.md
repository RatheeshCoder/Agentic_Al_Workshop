# 💼 Autonomous Agent for Industry Readiness Evaluation (LangGraph)

This project implements a robust **Autonomous AI Agent System** to evaluate a student's academic profile (from resume) against **current industry job requirements** using a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline. It leverages `LangGraph`, `Google Gemini`, `Tavily API`, `ChromaDB`, and `SentenceTransformers` to identify skill gaps, compute alignment scores, and suggest personalized upskilling paths.

## 🧠 Agent Workflow Overview

The system is structured as a **LangGraph-powered agentic workflow**, where each agent performs a distinct role in the pipeline:

| Agent Name           | Description                                                                                  |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `academic_extractor` | Extracts academic signals (skills, education, projects, experience) from resume PDF.         |
| `industry_fetcher`   | Uses Tavily API to fetch real-time job role requirements and hiring trends.                  |
| `rag_summarizer`     | Uses RAG (ChromaDB + Gemini) to generate deep analysis of industry expectations.             |
| `alignment_agent`    | Calculates alignment score by comparing academic skills vs industry skills.                  |
| `upskilling_agent`   | Recommends personalized courses, certifications, and project ideas based on missing skills.  |
| `reporter`           | Compiles all outputs into a final evaluation report with insights and actionables.           |

Each agent is modular, stateless, and connected using `StateGraph` from LangGraph.

## 🧠 Agents in the System

This project uses a **LangGraph-powered agentic pipeline**, where each agent is a modular, stateless function that performs a specialized role. LangGraph manages the flow of execution between these agents using a `StateGraph`.

### 🤖 What is an Agent?

In this system, an **agent** is:

- ✅ **Autonomous** – Operates independently using provided input state
- ✅ **Stateless** – Doesn’t retain memory; relies on shared `state`
- ✅ **Modular** – Focused on a single task
- ✅ **Composable** – Connected via LangGraph to other agents in a pipeline

| Agent Name            | Description                                                                                     | Why It’s an Agent                                                                                                  | LangGraph Role                              |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `academic_extractor` | Parses the PDF resume to extract academic signals like skills, education, experience, projects. | Performs a discrete, stateless task: extracting structured info from unstructured text (PDF).                      | First node in `StateGraph`, sets initial state. |
| `industry_fetcher`   | Queries Tavily API using multiple role-based prompts to fetch industry job requirements.         | Acts autonomously to retrieve real-world data for reasoning.                                                       | Second node, enriches state with search results. |
| `rag_summarizer`     | Uses Gemini + ChromaDB to summarize expectations based on RAG context.                          | Performs independent summarization with grounding. Takes state input, generates meaningful output.                 | Third node, adds `industry_gap_summary`.         |
| `alignment_agent`    | Compares parsed academic skills with industry-required skills and scores alignment.              | Acts as a decision evaluator agent using logic + data from past nodes.                                             | Fourth node, updates alignment score and skill diff. |
| `upskilling_agent`   | Recommends courses, certifications, and projects for the student based on missing skills.        | Generates personalized content independently, based on prior state.                                                | Fifth node, enriches state with recommendations. |
| `reporter`           | Generates final report including all extracted info, analysis, and recommendations.              | Summarizes the full agentic process into a consumable output.                                                      | Final node, just before `END`.              |
